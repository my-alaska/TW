# lab 2 - simple Producer-Consumer, deadlock

The aim of this laboratory exercise was to implement the solution for simplified Producer-Consumer problem and present students with risk of deadlock

The idea of this version of the problem is that even though the capacity of the buffer might be greater than one, producers and consumers always produce/consume exactly one buffer element when in original producer-consumer problem this number is a random value in certain scope
